# notes-api-server

This server is to be used in conjunction with notes-API-app (https://martinkuracka.github.io/notes-API-app/). It has to be downloaded, initialised and run locally in order for it to function as intended - because it also includes mock DB for getting/submitting/editing/deleting notes.
